# üèóÔ∏è 2-Tier Web Application AWS Infrastructure with Terraform

This project provisions a **2-tier web application infrastructure** on **AWS** using **Terraform**.  
It automates deployment of a scalable and highly available environment consisting of an **application layer** (EC2 servers) and a **data layer** (RDS and ElastiCache).  

The infrastructure ensures performance, scalability, and fault tolerance using AWS managed services such as **Auto Scaling**, **Load Balancer**, **SNS Notifications**, and **CloudWatch Metrics**.

## üß© Architecture Overview

### **Core Components**
- **VPC**: Custom Virtual Private Cloud with public and private subnets.
- **Security Groups**: Configured to restrict inbound/outbound traffic.
- **EC2 Launch Template**: Defines reusable configuration for EC2 instances.
- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**: Dynamically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on CPU utilization.
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
- **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Managed PostgreSQL instance as the primary data store.
- **ElastiCache (Redis)**: Caching layer to improve performance.
- **S3 Bucket**: Stores the remote Terraform state file for team collaboration and persistence.
- **SNS (Simple Notification Service)**: Sends notifications for auto scaling activities.
- **CloudWatch Metrics**: Triggers Auto Scaling actions when CPU utilization crosses defined thresholds (e.g., 50%).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before running this infrastructure, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- An **AWS account** with sufficient permissions (EC2, VPC, RDS, IAM, ELB, etc.)
- AWS credentials configured locally (`~/.aws/credentials`)

## üîë AWS Authentication Setup

You can configure your AWS credentials using the CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```

Provide the following when prompted:
AWS Access Key ID: <your-access-key>
AWS Secret Access Key: <your-secret-key>
Default region name: <your-region>
Default output format: json

## üöÄ Deploying the Infrastructure
```bash
# Initialize Terraform (downloads required providers and modules)
terraform init

# Review the execution plan
terraform plan

# Apply the configuration to create infrastructure
terraform apply
```

To destroy the entire infrastructure when no longer needed:

```bash
terraform destroy
```
